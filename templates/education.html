                        As the focus of programming switches from the traditional desktop to web-based applications, learning how to develop for
                        the web is getting increasingly critical. This essential course taught me exactly
                        that. Throughout the semester, I was taught the skills necessary to develop a full-stack
                        web application. Using Ruby on Rails as a framework, I learned the ins-and-outs of
                        the MVC architecture to separate implementation concerns, as well as how to apply
                        it to create useful, dynamic web applications.

                        As time goes on, consumers are getting increasingly impatient with devices and applications with poor performance. What's
                        worse, far too many programmers are entirely focused with getting their content published,
                        without giving a second thought to the efficiency of their programs. Not only did
                        this class introduce me to several of the data structures and algorithms that give
                        these applications an edge in performance, it also taught me how to use discern which
                        ones to use in order to maximize efficiency and minimize computational complexity.

                        As developers are aware, actual coding is not the only piece to software development, not by a long shot. Taylor's Software
                        Engineering course gave me exposure to the other pieces to the software development
                        lifecycle, such as requirements-gathering, designing, and testing. Not only that,
                        it also helped me understand the vast benefits of agile development through a semester-long
                        group project. I was selected as a leader of the team, so I was also able to improve
                        my leadership through project management.

                        Like Software Engineering, Software Studio helped me gain real-world expertise in software development. However, unlike Software
                        Engineering, this course was much more focused on the actual coding and less on the
                        other parts of software development. Throughout the entire semester, I spent 12 hours
                        a week helping to develop a Django web application for Tiny Hands, a Christian non-profit
                        organization. This course really helped me further my understanding of what software
                        development was like outside of an academic setting.

                        In a world that is getting increasingly mobile, knowing how to create applications for smartphones is a highly valued skill.
                        However, simply getting an application working doesn't cut it in our highly competitive
                        society. Throughout this course, I learned how to use Android Studio to create rich,
                        powerful applications that effectively utilize smartphone features, without unnecessarily
                        compromising performance and power efficiency.

                        he will not know how to solve certain problems efficiently. In addition to teaching
                        me how different programming languages are structured, this course also taught me some
                        of the different language paradigms, and how to determine which one best solves a
                        particular problem.

                        it to be of value, it has to be stored <em>somewhere</em>: namely, databases. This fall,
                        I will be exploring how database technologies work, as well as how to store and
                        interact with data most effectively and efficiently.

                        it is essential for developers to know all of the common attacks and defensive
                        programming techniques. This fall, I will learn the details of how these attacks work,
                        as well as how to ensure that the software I write defends against such vulnerabilities.
